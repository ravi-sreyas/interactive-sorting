# interactive-sorting
Repository aims to help understand sorting algorithms using basic graphics such as bar graphs to walk through each step done.

Steps to help run the simulation :
--------------------------------

    1. Enter the number of random numbers to be generated for which you would like to apply the sorting algorithm 
    and hit 'Generate'
    
    2. Pick you desired sorting algorithm from the drop down
    
    3. Hit 'Sort me' to initiate the sort
    
    4. The elements picked for comparison (in bubble and quick sort),  
    the pivot element (in quick sort), 
    or the selected element range (in merge sort) is highlighted by appropriate color codes.
    
    5. Each step done in the sorting is simulated in the UI by updating the displayed numbers array and bar graph
    
    6. Finally, the expected value of 'Time and Space complexity' 
    is compared with the value obtained during actual sort
